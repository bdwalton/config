# $#@#$#@$ solaris and it's horrible frickin' path requirements...

# These are paths that we might find on solaris machines where various things
# are installed, but may be very stale (old gcc's, etc).  We want to search
# them, but only after other places that might have more modern versions of
# things.  Anything else in here should have a specific enough name that we
# won't care whether it's last or not.

# These paths have the best chance of storing modern versions of tools we want
# (eg: decent gnu stuff).  List these in reverse order of preference
PREFERRED="/usr/sfw/bin /local/studio11/SUNWspro/bin /opt/csw/gcc4/bin /opt/csw/bin /opt/csw/gnu"
# Other: We want these, but only because we have to.
